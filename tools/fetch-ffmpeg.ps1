<#
.SYNOPSIS
  Downloads the FFmpeg shared build (LGPL) for Windows x64 and places its DLLs
  + ffmpeg.exe in runtimes/win-x64/native/. ffmpeg.exe is what the recorder and
  clip-exporter shell out to. Everything is git-ignored — every dev runs this once.

.NOTES
  Source: BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds GitHub releases (https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds).
  Version pin: n7.1 (matches FFmpeg.AutoGen 7.1.x bindings), taken from a dated
  release rather than the rolling `latest` tag - `latest` only keeps the branches
  BtbN currently builds, and n7.1 was dropped from it in August 2026 (master /
  n8.1 / n9.0 remain), which 404'd this script. The SHA-256 below turns a swapped
  or truncated archive into a failure here instead of at runtime.
  Build flavor: lgpl-shared (no GPL components; safe to redistribute alongside
  a closed-source app provided DLLs remain replaceable).

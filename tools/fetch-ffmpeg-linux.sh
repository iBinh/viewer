# Downloads the FFmpeg shared build (LGPL) for Linux x64 and places its .so
# libraries + the ffmpeg binary in runtimes/linux-x64/native/. The shared libs
# are what FFmpeg.AutoGen's DynamicallyLoaded loader dlopen()s for live decode;
# the binary is what the subprocess recorder/clip-exporter shell out to.
# Everything is git-ignored — every dev (and CI) runs this once.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (issue #35): the app binds FFmpeg.AutoGen 7.1.1, generated
# against the FFmpeg n7.x ABI, so the loader resolves version-suffixed sonames
# (libavcodec.so.61, libavformat.so.61, libavutil.so.59, ...). No current Ubuntu
# LTS ships FFmpeg 7 — 24.04 has 6.1 (libavcodec.so.60), 22.04 has 4.4 — so
# `apt install ffmpeg` cannot satisfy the ABI and live view dies with
# "FFmpeg native libraries failed to load for runtime linux-x64". Bundling the
# matching n7.1 libs next to the binary makes the linux-x64 release self-
# contained, exactly like fetch-ffmpeg.ps1 does for win-x64.
#
# Source:  BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds GitHub releases (https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds).
# Pin:     n7.1 (matches FFmpeg.AutoGen 7.1.x bindings), from a dated release
#          rather than the rolling `latest` tag. `latest` is rebuilt daily and
#          only keeps the branches BtbN currently builds: n7.1 was dropped from
#          it in August 2026 (only master / n8.1 / n9.0 remain), which 404'd this
#          script and took CI down with it. A dated tag keeps its assets, and the
#          SHA-256 below makes a silently swapped or truncated archive fail here
#          instead of at runtime.
# Flavor:  lgpl-shared (no GPL components; redistributable alongside the app as
#          long as the .so remain shared + replaceable — see README "Licensing").

## Features

- **Live RTSP** — h264 / h265, software + hardware decode (D3D11VA / VAAPI /
  VideoToolbox / Android MediaCodec), auto-reconnect, auto SD/HD switching.
- **Multi-camera grid** — up to 25 streams, tabbed layouts, drag-reorder,
  fullscreen kiosk mode, low-cost "stills" mode (periodic HTTP snapshots).
- **Single-camera view** — PTZ joystick for sweeping plus a step keypad for
  framing (one nudge per press, home position, move speed), presets,
  telemetry overlay, digital zoom (pinch / Ctrl+wheel), snapshot to disk +
  share. Which PTZ controls appear is read from the camera, so a device that
  cannot step or go home is not offered buttons that would fail.
- **AI detection (local)** — ONNX object detection on-device (person / car /
  animal…), boxes in the grid and single view, auto-record on detection.
  No cloud: the model runs in-process.
- **Audio** — one-tap listen (AAC/PCM) and push-to-talk to cameras with an
  RTSP backchannel.
- **Recording & archive** — segmented MP4 via `-c copy`, in-app player with
  seek, clip export.
- **Camera discovery** — ONVIF / mDNS / opt-in subnet sweep with OpenIPC
  web fingerprinting, multi-add from one scan, manual add, QR-code add.
- **Majestic integration** — read / apply config with diff preview, raw JSON
  editor, RTMP push, day / night / auto mode.
- **Device tools** — SSH terminal, remote file manager, reboot / clock / log
  snapshots over SSH.
- **Health & status** — unified per-camera verdict (online / attention /
  offline) across grid, library and a Health Center overview.
- **Events & notifications** — motion + detection log, system notifications
  with quiet hours.
- **Desktop niceties** — tray icon with quick actions, optional
  close-to-tray, light/dark themes with accent colors.
- **Camera groups**, English / Russian UI (runtime switch), responsive layout
  (sidebar ↔ bottom tab strip).
- **Web console (self-host)** — run the same binary with `--server-only` for a
  browser UI to your cameras over the LAN: live grid with saved layouts, PTZ,
  network discovery, camera management, config backup, and accounts with
  per-user permissions and camera subsets. No cloud. See the
  [self-hosting guide](docs/web-server.md).

## Download

Pre-built **standalone** binaries are attached to each
[GitHub release](https://github.com/OpenIPC/viewer/releases). No
installer is required for the beta — download, extract, run:

| OS | Asset | Run |
|---|---|---|
| Windows x64 | `openipc-viewer-win-x64.zip` | extract, run `OpenIPC.Viewer.Desktop.exe` (accept the SmartScreen prompt — builds are unsigned for now) |
| Linux x64 | `openipc-viewer-linux-x64.tar.gz` | extract, `chmod +x`, run `./OpenIPC.Viewer.Desktop` |
| macOS arm64 | `openipc-viewer-osx-arm64.tar.gz` | extract, right-click the app → *Open* (Gatekeeper blocks unsigned builds on first launch) |
| Android arm64 | `*-Signed.apk` | sideload (debug-signed, not Play-signed) |

Each build is self-contained (bundles the .NET runtime), so there's nothing
to install alongside it. Native installers and in-app auto-update may come in
a later release.

### Runtime requirements

- **Windows** — none. FFmpeg DLLs ship inside the archive.
- **Linux** — just libsecret for the keyring:
  ```
  sudo apt install libsecret-1-0 libsecret-tools
  ```
  FFmpeg ships **inside the archive** (matching `n7.1` `.so`) — do *not* rely on
  `apt install ffmpeg`. The app binds the FFmpeg 7.x ABI (`libavcodec.so.61`),
  but no current Ubuntu LTS packages FFmpeg 7 (24.04 has 6.1 → `libavcodec.so.60`,
  22.04 has 4.4), so a system FFmpeg would fail to load with *"FFmpeg native
  libraries failed to load for runtime linux-x64"*. The bundled libs sidestep
  the distro version entirely. VAAPI hardware decode still needs
  `/dev/dri/renderD128` and your user in the `render` (or `video`) group.
  Credentials use `secret-tool` against the GNOME/KDE keyring, with an AES-GCM
  file fallback if D-Bus is unavailable.
- **macOS** — Homebrew FFmpeg (`brew install ffmpeg`). VideoToolbox HW decode
  works on any Mac 12+. Credentials live in the Keychain via `security`.

> **Validation caveat.** Linux / macOS / Android / iOS code paths build + link
> in CI but aren't yet end-to-end tested on real devices for every commit.
> Feedback is welcome — open an issue with OS version, what you did, and what
> happened.

## Web console (self-host)

The same binary can run headless as a small web server, serving a React
single-page UI for your cameras to any browser on your network — live grid with
saved layouts, PTZ, network discovery, and accounts with per-user permissions and
camera subsets. No cloud, no extra services:

```bash
export OPENIPC_WEB_ADMIN_PASSWORD='choose-a-strong-one'
./OpenIPC.Viewer.Desktop --server-only --lan --port 8787
# then open http://<this-machine-ip>:8787 and log in as admin
```

Localhost-only by default; `--lan` opts into network exposure. For an HTTPS
domain put it behind a reverse proxy. Full instructions — flags, adding and
finding cameras, users and permissions, ffmpeg, Caddy/nginx + systemd examples —
are in the self-hosting guide ([English](docs/web-server.md) ·
[Русский](docs/web-server.ru.md)).

## Building from source

```bash
dotnet restore OpenIPC.Viewer.slnx
dotnet build   OpenIPC.Viewer.slnx
dotnet test    OpenIPC.Viewer.slnx --no-build
dotnet run --project src/OpenIPC.Viewer.Desktop
```

Build runs with `TreatWarningsAsErrors=true`; any warning fails the build.
The web console's React SPA is built by the same `dotnet build` (`npm ci` +
`npm run build`, then embedded into `OpenIPC.Viewer.Web.dll`), so Node is a
prerequisite if you want the browser UI (CI builds it with Node 22). Without
Node the build still succeeds and the server runs API-only; pass
`-p:BuildWebClient=false` to skip it deliberately.

Run the FFmpeg fetch script for your OS once — it downloads the bundled
shared-build (`n7.1` ABI) from `BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds` into `runtimes/<rid>/native/`:
`tools/fetch-ffmpeg.ps1` (Windows → `win-x64`) or `tools/fetch-ffmpeg-linux.sh`
(Linux → `linux-x64`). macOS uses the system Homebrew FFmpeg (see
[Runtime requirements](#runtime-requirements)).

### Android

```bash
dotnet workload install android
dotnet build src/OpenIPC.Viewer.Android/OpenIPC.Viewer.Android.csproj -c Release
```

CI cross-compiles FFmpeg `n7.1` for `android-arm64` via NDK r27c on every
build (cached when version/script unchanged). Recording uses in-process
libavformat + a foreground service (`foregroundServiceType=dataSync`) and
needs `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` on Android 13+, prompted on first record.
Credentials use an AES-GCM file keyed off `Settings.Secure.AndroidId`.

### iOS

```bash
dotnet workload install ios
dotnet build src/OpenIPC.Viewer.iOS/OpenIPC.Viewer.iOS.csproj -c Release    # Mac-only for the link step
```

iOS recording is **foreground-only** — Apple doesn't grant 24/7 background
captures to surveillance apps. Credentials use an AES-GCM file keyed off
`UIDevice.identifierForVendor`. CI builds an unsigned `.app`/`.ipa`;
TestFlight signing arrives in the release-polish phase.

## Project layout

```
src/
  OpenIPC.Viewer.Core/            netstandard2.1 — domain, no IO, no UI, no package deps
  OpenIPC.Viewer.Infrastructure/  net9.0         — SQLite, secrets, decoder factories
  OpenIPC.Viewer.Video/           net9.0         — FFmpeg pipeline (FFmpeg.AutoGen + SkiaSharp)
  OpenIPC.Viewer.Analytics/       net9.0         — ONNX object detection (Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime)
  OpenIPC.Viewer.Devices/         net9.0         — ONVIF, Majestic HTTP, SSH, discovery sources
  OpenIPC.Viewer.App/             net9.0         — Avalonia views and viewmodels (cross-platform)
  OpenIPC.Viewer.Composition/     net9.0         — shared DI registrations (used by every head)
  OpenIPC.Viewer.Web/             net9.0         — Kestrel host + REST API for the self-hosted console
  OpenIPC.Viewer.Web.Client/      —              — React + Vite SPA, built and embedded into the Web dll
  OpenIPC.Viewer.Desktop/         net9.0         — Win/Lin/Mac host, classic-window lifetime
  OpenIPC.Viewer.Android/         net10.0-android — Android host (min API 31), foreground-service recording
  OpenIPC.Viewer.iOS/             net10.0-ios     — iOS host (min 16), foreground-only recording
tests/
  OpenIPC.Viewer.Core.Tests/           xUnit
  OpenIPC.Viewer.Devices.Tests/        xUnit — ONVIF, Majestic, discovery
  OpenIPC.Viewer.Infrastructure.Tests/ xUnit — SQLite, migrations, secrets
  OpenIPC.Viewer.Analytics.Tests/      xUnit — detection pre/post-processing
  OpenIPC.Viewer.Web.Tests/            xUnit — API, auth, permissions
  OpenIPC.Viewer.Video.Tests/          xUnit + MediaMTX integration
```

`App` references `Core` only. Infrastructure, Video, Devices and the platform
trio (`IFileSystem` / `ISecretsStore` / `IHwDecoderFactory`) are wired into
each head via `OpenIPC.Viewer.Composition.SharedComposition.AddSharedServices()`.

## Test fixture: MediaMTX

The video integration test and manual smoke depend on a local RTSP source.
A MediaMTX container synthesises a 1280×720@25 h264 test pattern on demand at
`rtsp://localhost:8554/test`.

```bash
docker compose -f tools/mediamtx/docker-compose.yml up -d
# ... do your testing ...
docker compose -f tools/mediamtx/docker-compose.yml down
```

The integration test auto-skips itself if the container isn't reachable.

## User data

Per-platform AppData root:

| OS | Path |
|---|---|
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenIPC.Viewer\` |
| Linux | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/openipc-viewer/` (default `~/.local/share/openipc-viewer/`) |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/OpenIPC.Viewer/` |
| Android | `/data/data/org.openipc.viewer/files/` (app-private; uninstall wipes) |
| iOS | `~/Library/Application Support/OpenIPC.Viewer/` (sandbox; Files-app visible via UIFileSharingEnabled) |

Inside the root:

```
logs/openipc-viewer-{date}.log    rolling daily, 7-day retention
appsettings.json                  optional override over the one shipped with the app
usersettings.json                 settings written by the in-app Settings page
openipc-viewer.db                 SQLite (cameras, recordings metadata, events)
secrets.bin / secrets.salt        encrypted credential fallback (used when no native keystore)
snapshots/{camera}/*.jpg          manual snapshots
recordings/                       MP4 segments (Linux/macOS may override via XDG_VIDEOS_DIR / ~/Movies)
```

Credentials live in the native keystore when available (Windows DPAPI /
macOS Keychain / Linux libsecret); the encrypted-file fallback is used
otherwise.
